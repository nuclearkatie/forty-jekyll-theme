					The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group is a community of nuclear engineers, scientists, programmers and students who focus on the development of reliable software tools for the analysis of complex nuclear systems.
					Two primary areas of activity are:
					<ul>
						<li>Radiation transport and effects in complex CAD-based geometries, and</li>
						<li>Agent-based modeling of advanced nuclear fuel cycles</li>
					</ul> </p>
